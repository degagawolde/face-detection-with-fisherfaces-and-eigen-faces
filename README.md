# face-detection-with-fisherfaces-and-eigen-faces


<p>
  Fisher faces algorithm uses Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA). LDA helps the algorithm to </br>
  differentiate the faces more efficiently than the eigenfaces because it maximizes the </br>
  between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter,
  </p>

<p>
  Eigen faces uses principal componenst analysis to extracts patterns form the face data and develop </br>
  a unique feature for each person data.
